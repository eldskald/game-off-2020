# From the Core

From the Core is a metroidvania with no upgrades. It still has backtracking, seemingly innaccessible places and progression, it's just in a different way. You have all the abilities, you just don't know it yet. Instead of finding the abilities, you find tutorial rooms, much like the animals in Super Metroid that taught you how to wall jump and shinespark. It was made for the 2020 Game Off game jam. It is completely open sourced, with the MIT license and all the assets are CC0.

## How to access the code

You need the Godot game engine. The game was made in version 3.2.3, but any 3.2.x will probably work just fine. You can download Godot [here](https://godotengine.org/).

## Getting Started

After cloning/downloading the repo, run Godot, click Scan and select the *source* folder where you downloaded the repository. Then, just open the project and you're good to go.

If you don't know anything about development and just want to play the game, you can press F5 to play it. You can also make a build by going into Project, Export, and choosing your platform. Godot will build an app you can run freely and without Godot.
